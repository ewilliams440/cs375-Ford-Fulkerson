- Starts by taking input from an input file in the form "[node] [node] [capacity]"
- For simplicity I have it assume that the first node in the file is the source and the last node in the file is the sink
- While loop that calls "dfs" and then updates maxflow accordingly
- Sample input in input.txt creates the same graph as used in this website: https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_graphs_fordfulkerson.php
