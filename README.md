# cs375project
Some notes:
- takes input from an input file in the form "[node] [node] [capacity]"
- for simplicity I have it assume that the first node in the file is the source and the last node in the file is the sink
- I have a function dfs to find each flow path but it is unfinished and very much does not work right now. Also, a bfs might be easier(?)
- Please feel free to make any changes as this was mostly useful for me to just understand the problem
- I've been using this to help understand: https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_graphs_fordfulkerson.php
